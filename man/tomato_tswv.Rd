\description{
Intensively mapped TSWV incidence data reported by Cochran (1936) and Bald
(1937). The disease assessments were performed in field trials at the Waite
Institute (Australia) in 1928 and 1929. TSWV is a virus disease spread by
thrips.

\details{
The data set \code{field_1928}, reported by Bald (1937), was a set of four
plots. Each plot consisted of 14 rows containing 33 plants each, so that
there were 462 plants in each plot. The tomato variety Early Dwarf Red was
used in two plots, and the variety Burwood Prize in the other two. The
tomatoes were planted out on 15th October 1928. The two plots dedicated to a
given variety experienced different irrigation practices, using either
overhead sprays or trenches. Otherwise, all were treated alike. Weekly
records of TSWV incidence were performed from 6th November to 12th December.

The data set \code{field_1929}, reported by Cochran (1936), was a field of 24
rows containing 60 plants each, so that there were 1440 plants. The tomatoes
were planted out in 26th November 1929. TSWV incidence records made on 18th
December 1929, 31st December 1929 and 22nd January 1930 are reported in this
data set.
