\description{
Results of an experiment where two groups of 16 female rats were fed
different diets during pregnancy and lactation periods. One group's diet
contained a chemical under review, and the other one was a control. For each
litter, the number of pups alive at 4 days, and the number of pups weaned
(i.e. that survived the 21-day lactation period) were recorded.
